     Hi everyone,
this is my first Dev Bootcamp blog post. For those of you who don't know, Dev Bootcamp is a nine week immersion program where you learn all the ins and outs of coding. Currently I am undergoing Phase 0 which is a 10 week prep for the program. Normally, Dev Bootcamp students travel to San Francisco, Chicago, or New York to learn but I am part of the Local-Host pilot program that is coming to Columbus, Ohio.
This blog post is in response to a video by one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp http://vimeo.com/85001014. This video talks about how the school was formed, how it has changed, and what to expect from the experience now. Everything I have read and heard about Dev Bootcamp from those who have experienced it has been extremely positive. My take on the experience is that is a group of people all working together to learn how to code to the best of their abilities. Everyone will be pushing themselves to the limit but the environment is also extremely supportive. I get the impression that there will be things at the end of the nine weeks that I am not even aware they existed today. I see myself engaging really well with this type of culture. I've never been a 40 hours a week type of guy when it comes to work and school. After my job is done I have lots of side projects and hobbies that I like to work on and so I think the long hours of learning will not be culture shock to me. I think its going to be incredibly difficult but I think I will be able to do well.

        Before I first got admited to Dev Bootcamp I was pretty worried about all the work we will have to do and how stressful it will be. Finishing my first week has really changed that. Of course it was the first week and we didn't do any challenges but I found myself anxious and excited to get going on my lessons during work and hurrying to eat my dinner so I could get started. I am nearly a complete beginner to coding but Shereef's Fireside Chat really put me at ease. The other people of my cohorts seem to have much more expierence but Shereef compared a career as a software engineer to walking from San Francisco to Seattle. Thos with more experience may be about 100 feet in front of me, but in the grand scheme of things the difference is insignificant.

        Personally I'm excited to get going. I finished my first week's material with a few days to spare and am anxiously waiting the release of the new material. In the meantime, I'm using my lunch period to type up this blog and with my remaining minutes I'll be off to code academy to continue my lesson on Ruby I left off at when I started the program. Wish me luck!
