Schedule:

1. While testing, did you find any errors in your code? How did you handle them?
I found a few of my links didn't open. I went back to the code and saw I didn't enter them correctly. I don't have all my links completely functional because as of right now I don't have a completely functional site. For example, right now the "Projects" link won't go anywhere because I don't have any projects to present at this time. I could possible spend some time on the "About Me" section. As of right now though those links don't work. Additionally I would like to find a way to improve my sidebar on the right side. Currently I am manually linking blog posts and adding them to the page. I would like to find a way to automate that process. Additionally the link to my phone number didn't work as I expected so I will have to work on that in the future.
2. Did you receive any particularly helpful feedback? Why was it helpful?
A lot of feedback had to do with the visuals of my page. Currently the page is a bit ugly. I not the most visually creative individual but I think with some more time I can improve the page. Additionally some people recommended I freeze the different sections so when the page shrinks they don't move around. I like that idea a lot so in the future I think I will start trying to do that.
3. How do you plan to incorporate the feedback you received?
Like I mentioned above, I think I'm going to try to freeze on the sections so that when I shrink or expand the page they will not move around. I think that users would like that feature. I personally get a bit annoyed when I have to expand pages to read them correctly.
