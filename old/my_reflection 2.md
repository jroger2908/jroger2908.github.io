Discuss the following:
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
My process was to first simplify my wireframe. I had a video in my original wireframe and the page seemed to busy for easy use and too complicated for me to build at this point. After that, I did a bit of research on HTML to figure out how I would like to organize my page and how I would go about that. I spent a lot of time formating my page and then finally I finished the HTML. The CSS didn't take me very long because I have been spending a lot of time working with CSS.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to make the site look at lot better. I haven't been able to settle on a background color. I would also like to make the "About Jonathan" link go somewhere. I would like to do the same for the "Projects" link but I think it will take me a few more weeks of DBC to get started on that section.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
It took me awhile to learn this material for other challenges but I really didn't have many problems building this site. I think HTML in generally is pretty cool. My favorite thing is to make individual letters bigger but I haven't done that with my blog.
* Create a TODO list of features you want to add in the future.
I would like to have my twitter link on the side feature some of my latest tweets. Once I have more blog posts I want to figure out how to get them to load themselves onto the page and how to make my "Blog posts" sidebar work more effectively.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
w3schools was great. For making columns this site was great  http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/developing_with_web_standards/csslayout/2-col/ .
Additionally I found some simple yet effective blogs and looked at the source code.
