      When you make and element in HTML, you use CSS to modify it on the page. You can use CSS to adjust its positioning on the page, appearence in terms of style and color, and relation to other objects on the page. There are three properties of an element that you can modify to change its relation to the elements around it. They are margin, border, and padding. 
      The margin refers to the distance between the edge of an element and the bordering element. You can modify the margin on any and all sides of an element in order to change its position in relation to objects around it. Think of an element with a large margin as floating on an island. There will be no other elements nearby.
          element1 {margin: 10px}      element2 {margin" 20px}   
          Can you guess which element will have more space around it?

      The border refers to the four sides of an object. Usually you modify the border to make it visible (or invisible). You can also change the width to make it thicker or thinner, make it dotted or dashed, or change the colors. The border is a good way to visually emphasize an element on the page.
          element1 { border: solid}       element2 {border: dotted}
          Can you guess how the two borders of the elements will differ?  

      The last property is padding. Padding refers to the space between the writing inside an element and the border of an element. If you increase the padding there will be more space between the writing and the border of the element. This is another way to visually change your page.
          element1 { padding: 25px}       element2 { padding: 10px}
