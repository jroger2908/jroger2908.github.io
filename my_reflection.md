- Make the static div go to the bottom and have an absolute positiion (no matter what, it should always be at the bottom of the page - but not in the browser window) Make the footer 100% the width of the screen

- Make the absolute div a header at the top of the page with a fixed position so it's always at the top of the browser window. Make the width 95% of the entire screen and centered

- Move the relative div position to the right so it's like a right sidebar.

- Make a configuration that plays with margin, border, and padding. See if you can find a quick way to explain that to yourself.

In this image, I changed everything but the static div to relative positioning. I then made the margin-left for the static div 10% (its width is currently 90%) to move it left, the relative div had a border of 10px to increase the border size, the absolute div had a margin of 50px to keep other objects 50px away, and the fixed div had an increase in padding around the text expanding the box.

- Make a configuration that uses block and inline-block to see what the differences are
![display inline](https://github.com/jroger2908/jroger2908.github.io/blob/master/7.display_inline.png)
This above image displays images inline. As you can see, all of them are on the same plane in a line.

![display block](https://github.com/jroger2908/jroger2908.github.io/blob/master/7.display_inline-block.png)
The images above are all in an inline-block. This means they will move around in order to find space to be displayed inline.

## Release 3: Reflection
<!-- Remember, reflections should only take about 10-15 minutes to write -->
* Describe the Document Object Model. What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The Document Object Model is a way of editing HTML or CSS in a web browser instead of something like Subline Text. This has the advantage of being able to see the changes immediately instead of having to reload the browser. Additionally you can check and uncheck boxes inorder to see temporary changes. When you are done you can actually save any changes to your file.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
At first I did not like Chrome Web Tools. I thought the code school tutorial was really poorly done. The instructions were not very clear and it was difficult to find resources to help me. However I did really enjoy the assignment and spent a lot of extra time just playing around. I used to love legos as a kid so this type of thing is very enjoyable to me. Once I started using the Chrome Web Tool I liked it more. It was pretty easy to use. I would need a lot more practice to get good at it though. The same as the CSS. Additionally I only really used the CSS source tab instead of the element tab because I understand the source better. That means I did very little checking and unchecking of the boxes.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Yes. I had a lot of trouble moving the objects around. When I started altering the margins things got a lot easier. Additionally removing the positioning from some of the objects helped me a lot. I am sure that there are much smoother ways to do what I did. I hope to learn them because I will really struggle with more complicated webpages if I don't. Additionally I couldn't figure out how to shrink the divs to 30% of their normal size so I ended up just manually subtracting 70% from each one's height and width.
