## 2. Site Planning Reflection

*Remember, reflections should only take about 10-15 minutes.*

### Site planning

1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
My site's primary goal is to showcase myself as a developer. This blog will have my personal posts on various topics as a developer along with a showcase of my projects, contact information, and links to some of my websites such as LinkedIn.
2. What kind of content will your site feature?
. What kind of content will your site feature?
  The content of the blog will be some of my projects that I've done so far and links to my contact information. This blog will show off my projects and explain how and why I did them. Then I will have some content about me as a developer and all of my contact information.
3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
 I think the projects should be viewable on the main portion of the blog or an introduction of my projects and links to the full version. Other than name, number, and email, I think the links to my websites can probably be at the bottom of the page.
4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Since this is a technical blog, the target audience would be employers, recruiters, and other developers who want to see what I have to offer as a developer. Although there will probably be a little bit of content about myself, the site will probably stick to projects and accomplishments.
5. How do you think most users will find your site?
  I think the best way to showcase this site is to have links to it on my websites such as LinkedIn and tweet links to it on Twitter. If I don't personally promote the site I think I will have trouble generating traffic to it.
6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I think the "primary action" of the users should be to view the projects I have been working on or completed. Providing my contact information will not use up much space so I think seeing the portfolio should be emphasized.

- What did you learn about design and user experience?
I learned a lot about design and user experience. I learned that design is key to whether your site is going to be successful or not. I thought it was fascinating that 40% of people will leave the page if it hasn't loaded in 2 seconds.
- Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun planning your site and creating a site map? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I personally didn't like creating a site map. The biggest thing was that I haven't had much experience with it. I think that over time I will acquire comfort with it. I've never really looked at a website critically before unless it is extremely poorly designed.
- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
Starting off I really didn't even know how to begin so I asked a lot of questions about what a site map is exactly. I used a lot of google and I ended up looking through a lot of people's blogs.
- What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
I had trouble with the concept of a site map itself. I didn't understand how detailed you had to be with each page.
- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?
I feel ok about the competencies at this point but I would like to get a lot more practice.
- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
The part I enjoyed the most is now looking at websites differently. Over the last day when I go to a new page I end up looking at the design a lot more than just the content.
- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I found most parts of the challenge tedious. The research took longer than it should but that's ok.
