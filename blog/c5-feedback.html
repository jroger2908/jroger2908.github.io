    Identify one emotion that arose during a pairing session  <br>
A typical emotion I have during pairing sessions is frustration. The reason that frustration is the most common for me is that it can be caused for a number of things. The most common one is general frustration with lack of progress on a problem. This frustration certainly isn't unique to pairing challenges as I commonly, and maybe even more commonly, have the same feeling when I am working alone. Other times though, if I understand something well and my partner doesn't I become a bit frustrated that we haven't made progress. I have done a good job so far of being patient and talking through the issues. Hopefully I will be able to keep this patience in the future. Especially when phase 0 is over and we start doing DBC full time. <br>
Describe kind, actionable, and specific feedback <br>
Kind feedback is feedback that is honest but is presented in a respectful way. Telling someone they are great at code may be very nice, but if they are really struggling it is not very constructive. Additionally, telling someone they suck at coding is not constructive and is not nice. The best middle ground is to tell someone you think they need to spend more time on coding in order to improve. It is honest about what they need to do and it is also respectful. <br>
Actionable feedback is giving feedback that one can act upon to improve a deficiency. For example, telling someone they suck at coding doesn't tell them what they need to improve on very well whereas telling an individual they need to spend more time reading docs to understand things better is actionable. It tells them something to do.
Specific feedback is feedback that clear and has a specific example. Reading someone's code and saying it was confusing is not specific. Reading someone's code and telling them they have syntax errors on lines 18, 94, and 150 is specific.

Discuss the feeling of vulnerability when pairing and reading feedback <br>
Anytime I work with other individuals I feed a bit vulnerable. Before each of my GPS sessions I was very nervous. Whenever you work with someone you are letting them see you and your work before it is the finished product and that can be a scary thing. Reading feedback is also a bit scary. It's a bit unnerving to read what people really think of you as a pair partner. I think having vulnerability fears is healthy to a certain extent however as I have been successful in my pairing sessions and have gotten good feedback I am slowly starting to feel less vulnerable.
