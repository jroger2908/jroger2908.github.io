      In this week's technical blog post I was assigned to research any number of topics and write about them. While I intend to read up on all of them in my week off of work, I have decided to write about Ruby on Rails this week as it is the main emphasis in DBC. Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is an open source framework meaning that it is free and anyone is able to add to it at any time. The downside is that if you want something unique in Rails, there is no costumer service to call to try to get it. You will have to do it yourself. <br>
      Since Rails is completely new to me, I spent this afternoon working through the CodeAcademy "Build a Rails Application" tutorial to learn more about it. Ruby on Rails is based on the Request-Response cycle. This is the process of asking for and receiving a website that will be delivred to your browser. First, the browser will make a server request. The server is what interacts with our Rails application. Then, the Rails application will take the request and locate the right Controller and method to carry out the request. Lastly, the Controller will receive the data and pass it on to the View. The View is what you as a user would see when using this web application. <br>
      Generators are scripts that come iwth Rails. These Generators are commands that create new files which make up the application. These generators will by run in your command line terminal which is the interface that takes care of commands for our application. There are some other aspects of Rails that I will quickly summarize. The "config" is where we will find our rails route. These handle requests from the browser. The "db" is where we change the state of our database. "Gemfile" is where our gems are located and these add special features to our rails application. <br>
      While many other things I've read about Rails currently go over my head, there are a few more things I would like to emphasize before I conclude. Ruby on Rails was created to emphasize the Convention over Configuration and Don't Repeat Yourself principles. Convention over Configuration means that the developer will only have to specify unconventional aspects of the web application as opposed to ever aspect of the web application. This is useful because it will save a developer lots of time and pain sorting out errors. Don't Repeat Yourself means that information will be stored in one place and will be much easier to handle. For many of the reasons, Rails is now a widely used framework to build web applications because of its scalability and simple framework. I look forward to learning much more about Rails in the coming weeks and will perhaps be back to teach you more!
