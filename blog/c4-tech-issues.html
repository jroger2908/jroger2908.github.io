      One of the biggest issues facing the technology industry today is lack of diversity. Workers today are disproportionately white males compared to national diversity trends. Studies have shown that companies, especially startups, are more likely to suceed if they are more diverse. At first glance, one may look at a company that lacks diversity and assume there are some hiring biases that lead to a less diverse company. Of course its impossible to know how often this is true, a major cause is the lack of diversity in application pools. This trend has been increasing addressed by trying to improve education for women and minorities to try and produce more diversity in the application pool. Dev Bootcamp, the program I am currently enrolled in, offers a $500 dollar discount for women and minority applicants. In Columbus Ohio, where I currently live, there are MeetUp.com groups oriented towards women and coding (although men are certainly welcome to attend). While this will undoubtedly be a slow process in order to change trends, especially at higher positions in companies, the steps taken now will have a long term impact on diversity in the technology workforce.
