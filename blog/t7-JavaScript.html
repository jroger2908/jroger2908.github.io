      In Ruby, there isn't a clear distrinction between functions and methods. Ruby methods are used to bundle repeatable statements into a single unit. In JavaScript, functions are more complicated. <br>
      Functions are most simply explained as a section of code that accomplishes tasks. The Mozilla Developer Network defines functions as <i>"a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function can return a value."</i> <br>
      There are three essential and basic components to a JavaScript function. The name is a keyword that identifies the function. the parameters are input values for the function that are treated as local variables. The body is the code that is executued when a function is called. <br>
      var name = function(parameter) {body;}; <br>
      name(parameter); is used to call a function <br>
      The functions in JavaScript take and input and return the output. However in JavaScript, you must tell the function to return a value as there is no implicit return. <br>
      A method in JavaScript refers to a function that is defined within the context of an object. An example is toLowerCase() is a String object method. This method is used only with strings and will work only on strings. There are other methods that work with objects like document, window, and location. <br>
      The way I personally look at it, methods in Ruby do what takes both functions and methods to do in JavaScript.
