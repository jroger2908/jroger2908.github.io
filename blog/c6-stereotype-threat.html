     Imposter syndrome is a syndrome where individuals fear others will decide they aren't as talented as they previously believed and those individuals will be "found out". This is very common among highly ambitious people who are consistently trying to reach high goals that are tough to attain. This is also highly typical in higher stress fields. <br>
Unsurprisingly, imposter syndrome has shown to be unhealthy. Both for ones career and personal health. I personally have experienced imposter syndrome many times in my life. I think a bit of it stems from being a shyer, more reserved person, but also the lofty goals I tend to shoot for. As I've gotten older I've learned to try to project more outward confidence and use the "Fake it till you make it" mentality a bit more. Imposter syndrome is something I have already dealt with participating in Dev Bootcamp. Following week 1 of phase 0, I went over to a friend's birthday party and told a number of my friends about the program I had just started. Everyone I met seemed to have the impression I was a genius because I worked with computers and thought I was brilliant while I myself was still having trouble navigating terminal and had accidentally deleted all the files in my computer. It's been a lot like that when I tell people what I've been involved with lately. Everyone thinks I'm already a talented developer while I struggle on my challenges as much as the next guy.<br>
As I get better at coding I think I'll feel a lot differently about it. I think the biggest thing about the imposter is lack of confidence in your own abilities. The better I get at coding, I will become more confident in my abilities and feel less like an imposter.
