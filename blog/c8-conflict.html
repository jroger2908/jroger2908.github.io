     There have really only been two times in my life where I have been apart of major conflicts with other individuals. The first was with my grad school advisor which occurred over the course of a year and a half. The second is my most recent job with a coworker I was around frequently. For the sake of not shaming individuals in my blog, I will discuss conflicts that occur periodically in my hosthold. <br>
     I like with three other guys aged 22-30 in an old Victorian Era home. While we love our place, it is pretty small and so conflicts do occur based on close proximity to each other. One of the more common conflicts revolves around cleaning the kitchen. With four males that cook all of their meals, a rarity in my opinion, the kitchen gets a lot of use and abuse. Certain members of the household are better at cleaning than others but we all tend to chip in. Two members of the household work from home and so they make lunch and breakfast in the kitchen in addition to dinner. They tend to also be ones who are more particular about the kitchen being clean. While I understand why they want the kitchen clean all the time, they also use it at a much higher volume than the other two of us and so I feel that them running the dishwasher more frequently isn't a big deal. <br>
     The conflicts are never major but they usually revolve around some passive aggresive text messages being sent around. Usually I feel some anger when I receive them but nothing too major. Most of it revolves around me thinking this isn't the best way to deal with the conflict. However, I do improve my effort to do the dishes or clean the counter tops after receiving these messages. Looking back I try to be proactive about cleaning and taking it in smaller chunks. I think in the future as we all start to understand each other's needs we will get better at avoiding conflicts in the kitchen.
