      In this blog I was asked to think of a time in my life when I was the happiest. Some examples given were times of accomplishment, affection, creativity, justice, peace, or will-power. I have choosen to write about how I feel happiest in an effective leadership role. <br>
      I've always been told I'm a natural leader. Although I think I am maybe not quite a natural, I agree that I have a natural inclination to be a leader. I'm not an individual who naturally commands a room or demands attention. That is not my personality. Instead, I'm more of an individual who leads by example. When I'm not in charge of a group, I focus on getting tasks done that are assigned to me and keeping group moral high. I'm more naturally an introvert and so getting things done independently is one of my strengths. When I feel I have enough experience or skill to earn respect of the group, I tend to be a more vocal leader. When I was captain of my tennis team in college, I never gave lengthy speeches or pep talks. I try to keep it simple and lead by example. My main goal was to show up early everyday, give my best effort, and go above and beyond in my effort. When necessary I would get more vocal with my team but that only occured on a few occassions. <br>
      I'm probably most proud of successes that have occurred under my leadership. My tennis team won our conference and qualified for the NCAA tournament when I was captain after finishing second and missing out every other year. My college fraternity won numerous awards my senior year when I was Vice President. None of these things were accomplished solely because of me. I was in no way the best tennis player on my team and I was simply one of 13 officers in my fraternity. However being part of a functional team was very rewarding to me. <br>
      As I wrap up my last few weeks of my job, a lot of my coworkers have actually been asking me for career advice. I was actually very humbled by this because it indicates that they respect me as a coworker. It relates to me being a bit of a leader in our workplace even though I was one of the newer members. <br>
      I have definitely felt down on myself numerous times during phase 0 and have no doubt that I will feel down on myself during various periods of phases 1-3. It's important for me to remember my successes and my strengths that I bring to the table and stay positive. It will be a busy 9 weeks but attitude is everything.
