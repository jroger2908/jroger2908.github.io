  <h1>Enumerables</h1>

<p>In Ruby, Enumberables provide classes that have methods that are traveral, searching, and have the ability to sort. The each method is key to enumerables as it allows a method to iterate through each object.
There are three key enumerable methods that we will discuss today. They are map, group_by, and cycle.
<br>
map is a method that takes an enumerable object and a block and will run the block for each element. It will output each returned value from the block. The original object will remain unchanged unless you use map! 
<br>
We will now square the values of an array to show you how map works.
[1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * n } #=> [1, 4, 9] <br>
The map function here goes through the array object by object and performs a function defined by the block which in this case is multiplying n by itself (n * n). 
<br>
group_by is another method commonly used in Ruby. This method will group the collection of an array by the result of a block. A good example is grouping an array by even or odd numbers. <br>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].group_by {|i| i%2]  #=> {0=>[2, 4, 6], 1=>[1, 3, 5]}
As shown, the elements of the array are being grouped by whether they have a remainder of 0 (even numbers) or 1 (odd numbers).
<br>
cycle is a method that will call the block for each element in an array repeatedly forever or until you tell it to stop. A good example is cycling through part of the alphabet.
<br>
["a", "b", "c"].cycle { |letter| puts letter }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c...forever <br>
["a", "b", "c"].cycle(2) { |letter| puts letter } # print, a, b, c, a, b, c.
<br>
And there you have it. Some great examples of enumberators in Ruby.
