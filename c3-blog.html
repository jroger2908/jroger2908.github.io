      Before Phase 0 began in DBC, we took a quiz on the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> to help us analyze what type of learner we are. I fell under the abstract sequential category. An abstract thinker is one who is able to visualize and conceive ideas and understand what one cannot actually see. Abstract thinkers use their intuition and imagination to see broader implications. Sequential thinkers tend to organize information in a linear, stepwise manner. They tend to follow a logical train of thought as opposed to a more randomized pattern. </p>
    <p> I found myself identifying quite well with this assesment. Although I wouldn't consider myself an artistically creative type, I am imagitative and innovative when it comes to thought processes. As far as a sequential versus random thinker, there is no doubt in my mind I am a more sequential thinker. I like to go over processes again and again in my head to learn them. I have more trouble understanding concepts that are broader and I need to connect together.</p>  
    <p>Before Phase 0 began we also read an article on a growth vs fixed mindset. A fixed mindset thinks that all the success comes from one's intelligence and everything tends to be predetermined. A growth mindset individual believes they can improve and evolve over time to better ones self. Coming from a former college athlete, musician, and doctoral student, I clearly identify with the growth mindset. I think back to my first tennis lessons how I could hardly make contact with a ball and how I can now comfortably hit a serve at over 100mph. I personally cannot even understand the world of a fixed mindset individual. </p>
    <p> Phase 0 has been great so far. I am three weeks in (plus a two week break) and I cannot believe all that I have learned so far. It takes up almost all of my freetime and tons of energy but I am very pleased with everything I have learned so far. Looking at this next week's material the challenges look very tough and so I want to get going on them ASAP. Therefore I will cut this post short and try to go do just that.</p>
