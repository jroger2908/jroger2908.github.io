  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h3>Jonathan Roger</h3>

  <section>
    <p>There are two common aspects in Ruby called Arrays and Hashes that are used for programming. Both arrays and hashes are indexed collections of objects. Both have keys that allow access to their objects. Both arrays and hashes can store lots of values. It's more efficient to access arrays but hashes allow you to have more flexibility with your information. Let's see some information below.
    </p>
    <p> <h4>Arrays</h4>
      <br>number_array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] </br>
      <br>string_array = ["this", "is", "a", "string", "array"] </br>
      <br>boolean_array = [true, false] </br>

      Above is the structure of an array. There is a single variable (ex number_array) that stores a list of values (ex 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The values can be integers, strings, or booleans. Additionally an array can have a mix or strings, integers, and booleans.
      Each element of an array has an index. The index is the position of an object in an array. You can access an object of an array by calling its index.
      <br> Example: print string_array[3] </br>
      Output: "string"
      By calling the index 3, the "string" index will be accessed.

      Arrays are useful when trying to store large sets of information to be accessed later.
    </p>
    <p> <h4>Hashes</h4>
      <br> hash_example = { "key1" => value1, </br>
    "key2" => value2} </br>

    Hashes are best described with the "key" => value relationship. Each key will have a name (ex "age") and will be assigned a value 
    <br> hash_example2 = {"age" => 24} </br>
    You can store limitless amounts of information in hashes. 
    You can access the values quite easily.
    <br> Ex. print age["age"] </br>
    <br> This will return the value of 24 which is the age in this hash </br>
