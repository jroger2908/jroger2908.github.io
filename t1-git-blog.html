      This is my first blog post for DBC. This is my first experience using git and GitHub. The key fearture of git and GitHub is version control. Version control tracks the changes that are made to a document regardless of who edits it. It also keeps the original file. Another key feature I just learned as git and GitHub use a "track changes" feature similar to Microsoft Office so you can see exactly what was changed. It lists all the changes on your commits page. The benefit to using GitHub is that the projects you are working on are stored in a remote repository instead of a local repository. This is beneficial because many people can now access and work on the document. Additionally if files are accidently deleted on your computer (similar to what I did two days ago) the files are stored remotely and will not be altered.

	So far my first week of DBC has gone well. There is a lot to learn and I frequently feel a bit lost but I've been using my resources and learning a lot.
