    <p> On the eve of intensive portion of DBC, I am finishing up my last item on my to-do list before I can submit my final phase 0 material. Our last blog posts is about asking good questions. I think all of us have experienced asking a question only to be very disappointed by the answer. While sometimes this can be because there isn't a good answer out there or the person(s) asked aren't able to answer it to your satisfaction. However, when it comes to a technical field such as programming, the problem more often has to do with how you ask the question. If you simply ask "Why won't my program work?", that is in no way specific and provides no context for the respondent. There are several key aspects to asking a question which I will discuss below. <br>
      1. Context. The first key to asking a question is to provide context. If you are asking a programming question, the first thing you should say is what language you are writing in. Other good ideas for context is why you are asking the question. <br>
      2. Be specific. Simply saying you are returning an error will not be much help. Provide an example of the code you are using and ask a specific context such as "why am I getting a No Method Error?". <br>
      3. Explain what you have already tried. I think this is important when asking instructors. If you immediately run off to an instructor when you encounter an issue, they may get very annoyed and may not help you out. However if you explain the context, be specific, and tell them everything you have tried so far, it gives them a much better framework from which to answer your question. <br>
      Hope you enjoyed my final blog post! Now on to DBC!
